<h1>Nice to meet you, I am Diogo üòÑ</h1>

<h2> About Me ‚öôÔ∏è </h2>
My adventure into web-developing starts with a Mechanical Engeenering degree that I took some years ago; back then I was very interested in computing design tools like SolidWorks or Ansys. During my course I had the opportunity to use those tools and my first programming tool, MatLab!

After the course I enganged on one of my favorite engineering areas, control and maintenance. I worked for several years in the hospital industry 
I worked the next years, in the maintenance and prototype/mold industry as a planner (using planning tools like NextBitt), where I watched some of the computing tools referenced in action.

After my first years of work, I decided to take a step back and evaluate my options; as of today I am learning/working as Junior Web Developer, using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

<h2> Expectations :thought_balloon: </h2>
As a person who worked for the past 2 to 3 years, I have started to understand and value some factors in a workplace. For me, is it important to always be happy, and that is where I stand. I would love to work, in a flexible and younger team, where I can (most of the time) work remotely. I truly believe, that in the right environment, people can maximize their productivity, and devotion to a company or a job ‚Äì in my case, working from home and being able to have a flexible time schedule, would be the two things I would gladly appreciate in a job.Regarding myself, I believe I am methodical and definitely professional person; methodical in the sense, that when I have to do the same job every day, I find mechanisms to optimize the time and productivity. I am punctual and always show up at work, and I will always show interest to understand and solve the problems and obstacles ahead. As I said before, I believe that happiness is the key to a productive company ‚Äì I will always be happy and accomplished, if I feel like I am in the right place, giving an actual contribute for a company.As for my goals, they come across what I have said earlier. I would love to grow professionally in a flexible company. I would love to give my contribute to a company and be equally and fairly rewarded for that
