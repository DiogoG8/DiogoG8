<h2> About Me ⚙️ </h2>

<p>My adventure into web-developing starts with a Mechanical Engeenering degree that I took some years ago; back then I was very interested in computing design tools like SolidWorks or Ansys. During my course I had the opportunity to use those tools and my first programming tool, MatLab! :student:</p>

<p>Once I completed my course, I engaged on one of my favorite engineering areas, control and maintenance. I worked in the area for several years, mainly on the hospital industry. During this time, I was responsible for the planning of the maintenances inside of hospitals, which gave me a first insight on various planning tools.</p>

<p>Some years after my first work, I decided to go to the prototype/mold industry, where I was able to develop even more my planning skills and remember the various computing skills I have mastered in college!</p>

<p> After my two previous work experiences, I decided to take a step back from the area and evaluate my progress! 💭</p>

<p>As of right now, I am studying Web Developing at Wild Code School. So far I had the chance to learn the tools below :point_down: and expanded even more my knowledge on planning, with the usage of Agile, Scrum and GitHub Workflow methodologies.</p>
